What I Did

Created an Ansible Playbook to:

Install Docker on the target server.

Pull a specified Docker image from a registry.

Run the container automatically with the desired configuration (ports, restart policy, etc.).

Used Mobtrem as the environment to test and manage this automation.

Automated the whole process so that after running the playbook, the container is deployed and running without any manual steps.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Ansible – Configuration Management

Docker – Containerization

Mobtrem – Project execution & testing platform
